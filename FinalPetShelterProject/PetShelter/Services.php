					<h3><img src="./IMAGES/adoption icon.jpg">Adoption</h3><br>
					<p>We believe that adopting a pet can be a life-changing experience for both humans and animals. <br><br>
					   Pets have an incredible ability to provide unconditional love and companionship. <br><br>
					   Whether you're looking for a loyal canine companion, a playful feline friend, or a small critter <br><br>
					   to keep you company, adopted pets are known for their gratefulness and devotion. <br><br>
					   Numerous studies have shown the positive effects of pet ownership on human health. <br><br>
					   When it comes to adopting a pet, you have a wide range of choices. Shelters and rescue <br><br>
					   organizations are home to an array of animals, from different breeds and sizes to various ages and temperaments. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
					</p>

					<h3><img src="./IMAGES/Donation Icon.jpg">Donation</h3><br>
					<p>We delve into the transformative impact of giving pets a second chance by offering them a loving and forever home. <br><br>
					   Every year, countless animals find themselves abandoned, stray, or in overcrowded shelters. <br><br>
					   By donating a pet, you provide a much-needed lifeline to these innocent creatures, offering them a chance at a better future. <br><br>
					   Pet donations help alleviate the burden on overcrowded shelters and rescues, allowing them to focus <br><br>
					   their resources on providing adequate care and attention to animals in need. <br><br>
					   Pet donation offers an opportunity for individuals and families to experience these <br><br>
					   benefits by welcoming a furry companion into their lives. <br><br><br><br><br><br>
